Founded in 1945, Atlantis Research Laboratory is used by marine biologists as home base as they study aquatic creatures, the coral reef, the fish and aquatic plants that live nearby and the composition of the surrounding seawater. Atlantis houses sophisticated lab equipment and computers, enabling scientists to perform research and process samples without leaving their underwater facilities.

We have a long history of deep-sea explorations. 80% of sea creatures that have been discovered by us. What separates Atlantis Research from the competitors is our research lab at the bottom of the ocean. We have at least one lab in every single ocean and about 20 - 40 well-trained scientists there at all times. Atlantis is funded by donations from the general public and private institutions. Recently, Atlantis has been observing the effects of climate change and the deep ocean and figuring out a way to minimize the harmful effects. A large sum of funding comes from public tours of the research labs. A ticket includes a trip to the water elevator in the middle of the ocean and a 1-2 hour stay. The website is to advertise the recent findings of the research site to get more funding.

The website highlights the recent findings of Atlantis Research Laboratory.

Our website is depends on bootstraps and safari web browser. In theory, we would update the page every single day with a fish of the day, but here we only have an example. The sign in button would lead the user to sign in or create an account but right now it does not have that functionality. Our link icon was created using favicon.cc.

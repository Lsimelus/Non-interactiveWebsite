        <h2>Exploring the ocean's depths</h2>
        <p>Founded in 1945, Atlantis Research Laboratory is used by marine biologists as home base as they study aquatic creatures, the coral reef, the fish and aquatic plants that live nearby and the composition of the surrounding seawater. Atlantis houses sophisticated lab equipment and computers, enabling scientists to perform research and process samples without leaving their underwater facilities.</p>

          <p>We have a long history of deep-sea explorations and boast a record of having discovered 80% of sea creatures. What separates Atlantis Research from our competitors is our research lab is located at the bottom of the ocean. We have at least one lab in every single ocean and about 20 - 40 well-trained scientists there at all times. The scientists conduct research from the bottom of the ocean weeks at a time. If they ever desire the need to leave due to an emergency there are water elevators readily accessible at all of the stations. The elevators can hold up to 50 and can stop mid-lift/descent with a push of a button. The reason why the elevator can hold up to 50 people is not that there will be 50 scientists traveling at once. Rather, it is for the large pieces of equipment that will be going into the station. Every station has to submarines ready to depart at any time. The scientist are not permitted to leave the station with scuba suits because of the amount of pressure. The submarines they use are advanced and can handle 10x more pressure than other submarines can. This allows the scientist to explore the ocean floors comfortably without fear of technical failure. </p>
